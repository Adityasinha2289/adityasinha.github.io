    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Aditya Sinha, a passionate and ambitious sophomore at Bennett University with a relentless curiosity for technology and innovation. My journey in tech began with a fascination for how things work on the web, which quickly evolved into a deep interest in web development and programming. I thrive on learning something new every day and pushing myself beyond comfort zones to improve continuously. With hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Python, I’ve built a solid foundation in both frontend design and logical thinking. I’ve also taken on leadership roles, currently serving as the Management Head of ACM Bennett and a core member of DevOps Bennett. These roles have honed my organizational and team management skills, especially during key events like ACM's flagship fest INFUTURUM 3.0, where I actively contributed to its planning and success. I’m not just building websites—I’m building a future in tech that merges creativity, functionality, and impact. Whether it's coding a clean UI or leading a team to execute an event, I bring passion, responsibility, and a desire to keep growing
